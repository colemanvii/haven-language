# Haven Language

Haven Language is a grounded, human-scale language system for restoring clarity, orientation, and calm in modern life.

It exists to counter two failures of contemporary language:
- Abstraction that loses contact with lived reality
- Simplification that collapses into ideological signaling

Haven Language offers a third path: grounded simplification.

If language restores clarity, steadiness, and contact, it belongs here.
If it increases tension, abstraction, or performance, it does not.

This repository documents the principles, practices, and lexicon that power all Haven projects.
