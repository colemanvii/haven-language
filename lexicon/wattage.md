Wattage is the inner voltage of a person when they are aligned.

It is not motivation, mood, or energy level.
It is the capacity to perceive, decide, and act without inner fragmentation.

High wattage feels:
- Calm
- Clear
- Steady
- Unforced

Wattage drops when:
- Language becomes performative
- Decisions are rushed
- Attention is fragmented
- Inner signals are overridden

Wattage returns through:
- Orientation
- Rest
- Plain speech
- Fewer commitments
- Alignment between knowing and doing

Haven does not ask people to increase output.
It teaches them to protect wattage.
