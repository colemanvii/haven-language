Ignition is clean activation.

It is the moment clarity turns into motion.

Ignition feels like:
- Focus without panic
- Chosen speed
- A clear next step
- Willingness to act

Ignition is not anxiety.
Anxiety scatters.
Ignition concentrates.

Ignition usually follows:
- Orientation
- A period of glide
- A real constraint or deadline

Ignition spends wattage deliberately.
After ignition, return to glide.
