Glide is a calm, open perceptual state where effort drops and awareness widens.

It is not relaxation or disengagement.
It is clarity without force.

Glide feels like:
- Even breathing
- Soft focus
- Enough time
- Reduced inner commentary

Glide is not collapse.
Collapse is numb.
Glide is alert and receptive.

Glide emerges when urgency releases.
It cannot be forced.

Glide preserves wattage.
It allows insight to arrive without strain.
