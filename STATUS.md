## Status

Haven Language is intentionally small.

It is not designed to scale quickly, persuade broadly, or resolve debate.

It grows through:
- Use
- Time
- Embodiment
- Restraint

New terms are added only when something real cannot be named otherwise.

Silence is treated as a feature, not a gap.

If this repository feels quiet, that is by design.
